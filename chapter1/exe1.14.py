Aprogram is a set of instructions written in a programming  language that are executed by   a computer  '''

Exercise 3: A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming 
language into machine code that can be understood and executed directly by the computer's processor.
An interpreter, on the other hand, reads and executes the source code line by line without first compiling i
t into machine code. In other words, a compiler converts the entire program into machine code before running it, 
while an interpreter interprets the program one instruction at a time and performs the corresponding actions.

''' Central processing  Unit  - IN Humans thats the brain, its the brain of  a  computer. Executes  instructions and calculations
Main memory - in humans it  is the  short-term memory. it  holds the information briefly  as wework on it.
Secondary memory  stores long-term information.
Input  devices - In humans represents  the would be our senses on how we persive the world which allow us to perceive the world around us and send signals to our brains. 
For example, just as a keyboard inputs text into a computer '''
''' Output devices -  human equivalent of an output device would be our muscles,
which carry out physical actions based on signals from the brain. For example, 
just as a printer outputs a hard copy of a document.

reading Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what
you meant to say.
running Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often
if you display the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to spend some time to build
scaffolding.
ruminating Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime,
semantic? What information can you get from the error messages, or from
the output of the program? What kind of error could cause the problem
youâ€™re seeing? What did you change last, before the problem appeared?
retreating At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent changes,
until you get back to a program that works and that you understand. Then
you can start rebuilding.
